1.3 Python as a Calculator
python3
Try these calculations:

>>> 2 + 3
5

>>> 10 - 4
6

>>> 5 * 6
30

>>> 15 / 4
3.75

>>> 15 // 4  # Integer division
3

>>> 15 % 4   # Remainder
3

>>> 2 ** 3   # Power
8

>>> (10 + 5) * 2
30

Exit interactive mode:


>>> exit()
# OR Ctrl+D

1.4 Variables and Data Types
Basic Data Types

# numbers.py - Working with numbers
# Integer
age = 25
print("Age:", age)
print("Type:", type(age))

# Float
height = 5.9
print("\nHeight:", height)
print("Type:", type(height))

# String
name = "John Doe"
print("\nName:", name)
print("Type:", type(name))

# Boolean
is_student = True
print("\nIs Student:", is_student)
print("Type:", type(is_student))

# None (null)
salary = None
print("\nSalary:", salary)
print("Type:", type(salary))

Output:

Age: 25
Type: <class 'int'>

Height: 5.9
Type: <class 'float'>

Name: John Doe
Type: <class 'str'>

Is Student: True
Type: <class 'bool'>

Salary: None
Type: <class 'NoneType'>

Variable Naming Rules

# valid_variables.py
# Valid names
my_name = "John"
myName = "John"      # camelCase
my_name_123 = "John" # snake_case (Python preferred)
_name = "John"       # starts with underscore
name1 = "John"       # ends with number

# Invalid names (will cause errors)
# 123name = "John"   # Can't start with number
# my-name = "John"   # Can't use hyphen
# my name = "John"   # Can't use space
# class = "John"     # Can't use reserved keyword

Multiple Assignment

# multiple_assignment.py
# Assign multiple variables at once
x, y, z = 10, 20, 30
print("x =", x, "y =", y, "z =", z)

# Same value to multiple variables
a = b = c = 100
print("a =", a, "b =", b, "c =", c)

# Swap variables
x, y = y, x
print("After swap - x =", x, "y =", y)

Output:

x = 10 y = 20 z = 30
a = 100 b = 100 c = 100
After swap - x = 20 y = 10

1.5 Input and Output

Getting User Input

# input_example.py
# Get user input
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello,", name)

# Input with numbers (always returns string)
age = input("How old are you? ")
print("You are", age, "years old")
print("Type of age:", type(age))

# Convert string to number
age_number = int(age)  # Convert to integer
print("Next year you will be", age_number + 1)

Run:

$ python3 input_example.py
What is your name? Alice
Hello, Alice
How old are you? 25
You are 25 years old
Type of age: <class 'str'>
Next year you will be 26

Formatted Output

# formatted_output.py
name = "Bob"
age = 30
height = 5.9

# Method 1: Using f-strings (Python 3.6+)
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Height: {height}")

# Method 2: Using .format()
print("Name: {}, Age: {}, Height: {}".format(name, age, height))

# Method 3: Using % formatting (old style)
print("Name: %s, Age: %d, Height: %.1f" % (name, age, height))

# Method 4: Concatenation
print("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + str(age))


Output:

Name: Bob, Age: 30, Height: 5.9
Name: Bob, Age: 30, Height: 5.9
Name: Bob, Age: 30, Height: 5.9
Name: Bob, Age: 30

Formatting Numbers


# number_formatting.py
pi = 3.14159265359
number = 42

# Control decimal places
print(f"Pi to 2 decimals: {pi:.2f}")
print(f"Pi to 4 decimals: {pi:.4f}")

# Add padding
print(f"Number with padding: {number:5d}")  # Right aligned, width 5
print(f"Number with padding: {number:<5d}") # Left aligned
print(f"Number with padding: {number:^5d}") # Centered

# Binary, hex, octal
print(f"Binary: {number:b}")
print(f"Hex: {number:x}")
print(f"Octal: {number:o}")

Output:


Pi to 2 decimals: 3.14
Pi to 4 decimals: 3.1416
Number with padding:    42
Number with padding: 42   
Number with padding:  42  
Binary: 101010
Hex: 2a
Octal: 52

1.6 Comments and Documentation

# comments.py

# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a multi-line comment
or docstring. It can span
multiple lines.
"""

def greet(name):
    """
    This function greets a person.
    
    Parameters:
    name (str): The name of the person to greet
    
    Returns:
    str: A greeting message
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Test the function
print(greet("Alice"))

# View function documentation
help(greet)
print(greet.__doc__)

1.7 Type Conversion (Casting)

# type_casting.py
# String to numbers
age_str = "25"
age_int = int(age_str)
age_float = float(age_str)

print(f"String: {age_str}, Type: {type(age_str)}")
print(f"Integer: {age_int}, Type: {type(age_int)}")
print(f"Float: {age_float}, Type: {type(age_float)}")

# Numbers to string
count = 100
count_str = str(count)
print(f"\nNumber: {count}, Type: {type(count)}")
print(f"String: {count_str}, Type: {type(count_str)}")

# Float to integer (truncates)
pi = 3.14159
pi_int = int(pi)
print(f"\nFloat: {pi}, Integer: {pi_int}")

# Integer to float
num = 42
num_float = float(num)
print(f"Integer: {num}, Float: {num_float}")

# Boolean conversions
print("\nBoolean Conversions:")
print(f"bool(1): {bool(1)}")
print(f"bool(0): {bool(0)}")
print(f"bool(''): {bool('')}")
print(f"bool('hello'): {bool('hello')}")
print(f"bool(None): {bool(None)}")

Output:


String: 25, Type: <class 'str'>
Integer: 25, Type: <class 'int'>
Float: 25.0, Type: <class 'float'>

Number: 100, Type: <class 'int'>
String: 100, Type: <class 'str'>

Float: 3.14159, Integer: 3
Integer: 42, Float: 42.0

Boolean Conversions:
bool(1): True
bool(0): False
bool(''): False
bool('hello'): True
bool(None): False

1.8 Basic Operators

Arithmetic Operators
# arithmetic.py
a = 15
b = 4

print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}")
print(f"Addition: {a} + {b} = {a + b}")
print(f"Subtraction: {a} - {b} = {a - b}")
print(f"Multiplication: {a} * {b} = {a * b}")
print(f"Division: {a} / {b} = {a / b}")
print(f"Integer Division: {a} // {b} = {a // b}")
print(f"Remainder: {a} % {b} = {a % b}")
print(f"Power: {a} ** {b} = {a ** b}")

Output:

a = 15, b = 4
Addition: 15 + 4 = 19
Subtraction: 15 - 4 = 11
Multiplication: 15 * 4 = 60
Division: 15 / 4 = 3.75
Integer Division: 15 // 4 = 3
Remainder: 15 % 4 = 3
Power: 15 ** 4 = 50625

Comparison Operators

# comparison.py
x = 10
y = 20

print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")
print(f"x == y: {x == y}")
print(f"x != y: {x != y}")
print(f"x < y: {x < y}")
print(f"x > y: {x > y}")
print(f"x <= y: {x <= y}")
print(f"x >= y: {x >= y}")

# String comparison
name1 = "Alice"
name2 = "Bob"
print(f"\n'Alice' < 'Bob': {name1 < name2}")  # Alphabetical comparison

Output:

x = 10, y = 20
x == y: False
x != y: True
x < y: True
x > y: False
x <= y: True
x >= y: False

'Alice' < 'Bob': True

Logical Operators
# logical.py
a = True
b = False

print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}")
print(f"a and b: {a and b}")
print(f"a or b: {a or b}")
print(f"not a: {not a}")
print(f"not b: {not b}")

# Practical example
age = 25
has_license = True

can_drive = age >= 18 and has_license
print(f"\nCan drive: {can_drive}")

# Short-circuit evaluation
def get_true():
    print("get_true called")
    return True

def get_false():
    print("get_false called")
    return False

# and stops at first False
result = get_false() and get_true()
print(f"Result: {result}")

# or stops at first True
result = get_true() or get_false()
print(f"Result: {result}")

Output:


a = True, b = False
a and b: False
a or b: True
not a: False
not b: True

Can drive: True
get_false called
Result: False
get_true called
Result: True

carrying a message that would change everything...

Using their teleportation for the first time, Alex discovered
that they weren't alone. There were 7 other heroes in Tokyo,
each with their own unique powers!

Together, they formed a team to protect the city from evil.
And so began the legend of Alex, the hero with the power of
teleportation, defender of Tokyo!

📝 Week 1 Summary
What You Learned:
✅ Python installation and setup

✅ Basic syntax and variables

✅ Data types (int, float, str, bool)

✅ Input/output operations

✅ Type conversion

✅ Basic operators

✅ Formatted output

Common Errors to Avoid:

# 1. Forgetting to convert input
age = input("Age: ")
next_year = age + 1  # ERROR! age is string

# Correct:
age = int(input("Age: "))
next_year = age + 1

# 2. Division by zero
result = 10 / 0  # ZeroDivisionError

# 3. Mismatched types
result = "10" + 5  # TypeError

# 4. Undefined variables
print(x)  # NameError if x not defined
