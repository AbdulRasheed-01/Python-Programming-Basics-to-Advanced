✅ Solve real-world problems using control flow

   Theory Content
  2.1 Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
  
  Basic Syntax:
  
  if condition:
      # code to execute if condition is True
      statement1
      statement2
  
  elif another_condition:
      # code to execute if first condition is False and this is True
      statement3
  
  else:
      # code to execute if all conditions are False
      statement4

# Example 1: Simple if statement
age = 18
print("Example 1: Voting Eligibility")
if age >= 18:
    print(f"Age {age}: You are eligible to vote!")
else:
    print(f"Age {age}: You are not eligible to vote yet.")
print("-" * 40)

# Example 2: If-elif-else
print("Example 2: Grade Calculator")
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
    message = "Excellent!"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
    message = "Good job!"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
    message = "Fair"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
    message = "Needs improvement"
else:
    grade = "F"
    message = "Failed"

print(f"Score: {score}")
print(f"Grade: {grade}")
print(f"Message: {message}")
print("-" * 40)

# Example 3: Multiple conditions with and/or
print("Example 3: Scholarship Eligibility")
gpa = 3.5
extracurricular = True
family_income = 45000

if gpa >= 3.5 and extracurricular and family_income < 50000:
    print("Eligible for full scholarship!")
elif gpa >= 3.0 and (extracurricular or family_income < 60000):
    print("Eligible for partial scholarship")
else:
    print("Not eligible for scholarship")
print("-" * 40)

# Example 4: Nested if statements
print("Example 4: ATM Withdrawal")
balance = 1000
withdrawal = 500
pin_correct = True
daily_limit = 1000

if pin_correct:
    if withdrawal <= balance:
        if withdrawal <= daily_limit:
            balance -= withdrawal
            print(f"Withdrawal successful! New balance: ${balance}")
        else:
            print(f"Exceeds daily limit of ${daily_limit}")
    else:
        print("Insufficient funds")
else:
    print("Incorrect PIN")
